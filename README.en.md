# Universal Online Judge

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/vfleaking/uoj/blob/master/uoj/1/pictures/UOJ.png?raw=true"></p>

> #### An online judge system for universal purposes.

This repository stores the main part of the code of UOJ's official website (https://uoj.ac) for learning and reference.

To reproduce the runtime environment of the official website as much as possible, we put the entire website into a docker container.
But the current reproduction method is still not perfect, e.g., some runtime libraries need to be installed manually.
Therefore, please do not use the code in this repository if you need to deploy a UOJ system to a serious production environment, but you can use [the edition maintained by UOJ open source community](https://github.com/UniversalOJ/UOJ-System) instead.

This official website edition of UOJ has some functionalities that the community edition does not have. To support them in the community edition, you can modify the code according to the official website edition. You are encouraged to make a pull request to share your modification!

If you want to contribute some code to the official website, you can make a pull request to this repository. After code review, it will be merged to https://uoj.ac as well!

Thanks for everyone's support for this project! Feel free to join the official QQ group chat for discussion and making social connections: `590822951`.
